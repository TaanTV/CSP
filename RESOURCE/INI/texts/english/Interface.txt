Variable_lockpicking_guide_1
{Hacking locks allows you to open certain locked chests to obtain their contents. The process involves choosing the correct position for the lockpick inserted into the cylinder. The 'Ctrl' key is used to rotate the cylinder. Vertical mouse movement adjusts the angle of the inserted lockpick. Press 'Esc' to exit.}
Variable_lockpicking_guide_2
{By moving the mouse up and down, adjust the position of the lockpick. Once the angle is chosen, press and hold the 'Ctrl' key to start rotating the cylinder. To unlock the lock, the cylinder must be rotated 90 degrees.}
Variable_lockpicking_guide_3
{If the cylinder unexpectedly stops during rotation, it means the lockpick position is incorrect. In this case, release the 'Ctrl' key and wait for the cylinder to return to its initial position to release the lockpick. Remember, the closer you position the lockpick to the correct angle, the greater the rotation of the cylinder will be.}
