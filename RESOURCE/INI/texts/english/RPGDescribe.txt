{Reaction. It is necessary for such skills as light and medium weapon, pistols, boarding, and also affects the amount of maximum energy.}
Charisma
{Authority. The result of a combination of a manly wounded physiognomy and a well-hung tongue. The leader does not need to resort to force to take possession of the goods of a successful merchant - he will give it himself. The best people will follow him, and the most beautiful women will be waiting in every port. Leadership is a necessary attribute for skills such as authority and commerce. Affects: the number of officers joining.}

{Authority. A necessary attribute for skills such as authority and commerce also affects the number of officers joining.}

FencingLight
{The ability to handle light weapon - mainly rapiers and small-sized killing tools. It depends on the reaction and impression. (R*0.9+I*0.1)}

FencingHeavy
{Wielding heavy broadswords, axes, and swords requires remarkable physical strength. It depends on power and endurance. (P*0.9+E*0.1)}

Fortune
{Fortune. AKA Luck. It is needed everywhere. Depends on success.(S)}
Leadership
{Authority. When people see that you will not be lost in any scrape, they begin to believe in you, and now the taverns are full of those who want to join you on campaigns, and the enemy ships surrender as soon as they see your flag. And if the authority is high, you can be sure that your people will board the sea devil himself. It depends on authority and talent. (A*0.9+T*0.1) \n\n Important! If the maximum number of officers equal to Leadership*2+(white Authority/20) is exceeded, the main character receives a penalty in the value of authority equal to -200.}
Commerce
{Trade. The ability to sell more expensively what I bought cheaper yesterday. Knowledge of profitable trade routes, business acumen and friendly relations with store owners - all this fills your pockets with a pleasant weight and allows you not to think about such small things as the salary of the team or the lack of canvas in the hold. It takes a talent and a certain charm of a authority. (T*0.8+A*0.2)}
Accuracy
{Accuracy. One of the most necessary qualities for navigating the seas. A real captain will not waste gunpowder and cannonballs to scare away all the fish in the area, every volley is right on target! And when the salty wind hits the powder smoke over the bridge, the horizon should be clear of enemy tubs! You can't do without impression and a certain amount of success here. (I*0.8+S*0.2)}
Cannons
{Cannons. Quickly equip the gun, quickly roll up, and while the echoes of the shot have not yet subsided among the bulkheads - clean again, hammer, aim, do not forget to douse the gun with water in time so that it does not overheat... Amid the roar and flames of a deadly battle - nothing superfluous - charge, roll up, volley! It requires talent and power. (T*0.6+P*0.4)}
Sailing
{Navigation. The ability to bring a ship to port through a storm and fog. The ability to use navigation devices and control squadrons. The largest and most formidable ship will fly like a bird, easily obeying the firm hand of an experienced skipper. It depends on impression and talent. (I*0.2+T*0.8)
The lack of navigation leads to disadvantages in all the skills and characteristics of the hero.

Repair
{Repair. When the enemy brings down a hail of cannonballs on your ship, smashing the sides into splinters and turning the sails into a sieve, when the hull cracks under the hits of a squall, and the wind tears the rigging like threads, mending becomes the most important of the ship's skills. Endurance is the main thing here, but you can't do without impression either. (E*0.8+I*0.2)}
Grappling
{Boarding. Accurately bring the ship to the enemy's side, throw the hook-cats the first time and fall like an avalanche on a trembling enemy, sweep across the decks like a hurricane and take the enemy ship as a well-deserved prize - all this requires considerable skill and experience, but rich booty will easily pay off all efforts. Reaction and talent are needed. (R*0.7+T*0.3)}
Defence
{Protection. Day after day, the crew grows together with their ship, and now each sailor is already worth a dozen rookies from the tavern. To protect your people during the battle, not to let them die stupidly and senselessly is the task of a good captain. Endurance and authority of the leader are equally important in mobilizing the crew to protect the ship. (E*0.5+A*0.5)}
Sneak
{Stealth. To pass unnoticed by enemy guards, hide in the endless ocean desert from pursuers, or like a bolt from the blue to fall on a careless enemy - a good captain must possess this skill. This is impossible without high success and impression. (S*0.5+I*0.5)}
Loyality
{An officer's loyalty is determined by your deeds. Officers with a good reputation will not be able to work for a scoundrel for a long time, and scammers will not tolerate an honest life for a long time.}
Rank
{Rank is an indicator of the level of character development in the game. The rank changes stepwise with the acquisition of experience. Along with the hero's Rank, the hero's Life also increases by an amount depending on Endurance.
As the Rank increases, the hero will more often come across stronger opponents and new items.}
Life
{Life is an indicator of a character's resistance to physical damage. The more the character's life, the more stab, cut, chopped and gunshot wounds need to be applied to kill him.
Each addition of rank increases the life value by a value depending on the Endurance characteristic.}
Health
{Health is an indicator of the overall physical condition of the hero. The worse the health, the worse the hero's performance in the game becomes. Health deteriorates if the hero is injured a lot, and recovers if the hero does not participate in hand-to-hand combat for a long time.}
Energy
{Energy is an indicator and stamina reserve of a character in hand-to-hand combat. All attacking actions in hand-to-hand combat require the expenditure of the character's energy. In other words, during the fight, the character gets tired and needs a break to replenish his strength.
The maximum energy value depends on the current value of the character's reaction.}
Money
{Money is money. Doubloons, piastres, louis d'or, thalers, guineas... What difference does it make if all this variety is gold!}
Reputation
{Reputation is an indicator of how other characters treat a character. Reputation can be high (positive), neutral and low (negative). It is earned by the actions of the character and affects how the character is perceived by other actors in the game.
The hero's fame melts over time, his actions are erased from people's memory. The bad is forgotten worse, the good is faster. If you don't do anything, then the hero's reputation will eventually roll back to "an ordinary sailor".}
weight
{The carried weight is the maximum possible total weight of the load that the character can carry without losing his motor functions and while maintaining the skill level.
It depends on power and endurance.}
Title
{The rank is an indicator of how much benefit a character has brought to the power in whose service he is.}
NextExp
{The experience threshold shows how many points have been accumulated in the currently selected skill, rank, and ability and how many are left until the next point is received.
Skills grow from actions. For each, for example, well-aimed pistol shot, experience points are awarded in the pistols skill. The obtained skill points, in turn, fall into the experience of rank and personal/ship abilities (depending on the type of skill).
Passing the experience threshold of rank and abilities gives a new rank, which means that the hero's life and ability points increase, which the player can distribute at his discretion.}

***
Monthly maintenance is the total cost of salaries for officers and sailors, payments for injuries and injuries, and maintaining the ship's economy in proper order.
The share of loot is the division of captured valuables and the payment of shares to team members.
Captured ships and goods are subject to division. According to the customs of the Brethren, the shares of the dead officers and sailors go to their comrades and relatives.
***
Distribution of shares among team members:
- sailor - 1 share
- officer - 10 shares
- companion - 30 shares
- Captain - 200-650 shares
The share of the captain (player) depends on the difficulty level of the game (Sailor - 650, Admiral - 200).
In addition, the captain, as the owner of the ships of his squadron, receives an additional 20-120 shares for each ship (depending on the class of the vessel). At the same time, the captain assumes all expenses related to the maintenance and possible death of ships.}
Resort_hint
{Sorts the ships of the squadron by speed from the fastest to the slowest.
The order starts from the main character's ship.
***
This is done so that fast ships do not ram ahead of sailing ships, breaking bowsprit.}
CrewWeight_hint
{By default, the weight of the sailors is not taken into account when calculating the deadweight of the ship.
If this setting is active, the weight of each sailor (1ts) will be taken into account when calculating the deadweight of the ship.}
The delay in the payment of shares for the current month does not cause murmurs and discontent in the team until the end of the month. At the same time, early payment increases the morale of the team.

On the form of the "Nation", the current flag on the hero's ship is visible, which can only be changed at sea in order to hide its true essence. But the enemy of the power can be recognized both by ships at sea and by guards in the port. The hero's stealth affects the success of the deception. If the hero has a bounty on his head from his main nation, then he is considered an enemy even to her.
The recognition of the enemy takes into account the relations of the countries themselves and the bounties on their behalf.
Fast travel in enemy cities to the hero does not work.}
England_descr

Hunter_hint
{The attitude of the state, its citizens and soldiers towards you. Good deeds for the benefit of the country enhance the reputation of the nation, while bad ones can lead to a reward for the hero's head. And this is an eternal pursuit on land and sea, as there will always be bounty hunters.

{If this setting is active, then at the conclusion of a 10-year contract with a hired officer or PMC, in addition to maximum loyalty, he will receive semi-immortality. Such an officer will not die in battle, but will only lose consciousness and receive a temporary injury. Being a companion and having lost his ship, he will survive and come aboard to you even without the ability to "Rescue on a boat".
***
important: The number of such contracts is limited by the Leadership of the main character.
More precisely, the maximum number of contracts = Leadership * 2.
(That is, with the Leadership of 3, 6 contracts can be concluded)
So it makes sense to invest points in this characteristic at the start.
If you dismiss such an officer, the place for the contract will be freed up.

Buccaneers were forest hunters from French settlers who settled in the early 17th century on islands in the Caribbean belonging to Spain. Buccaneers' favorite weapon - musket: a large, almost two-meter, heavy pistol. It was used for hunting wild boars, as well as when it was necessary to hit the helmsman on an enemy vessel from a distance of 250 m. The Buccaneers were excellent marksmen. They fired their muskets as they swam up to the ship, thereby making boarding easier for themselves.
