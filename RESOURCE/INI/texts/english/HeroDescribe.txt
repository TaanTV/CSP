Trader
{
Those who dare to engage in trade in the waters of the Caribbean archipelago, teeming with privateers, pirates and just robbers of various stripes, will not only have to track prices on the islands in order to maximize profits, but also learn to hold the blade firmly in order to keep this profit.
(it has more favorable purchase and sale prices, increased freight delivery time, copes better with rats on the ship, can receive additional trade information (with discounts), as well, also has +35 max load)
}
Fencer
{
Basic fencing training is not just about "admiring the sword" and dodging the lightning attacks of the enemy. It's a martial art. The art of quickly solving any issues "in one motion", while not remaining damaged.
(has a 10% chance of dodging attacks, +5% chance of a critical hit - combined with other perks)
}
Adventurer
{
Adventures are the real life of a free adventurer. And if you can get good dividends in the pursuit of them, then why not take full advantage of it?
(has a second chance at an excuse when detected by an enemy, increases the chance of meeting a treasure dealer in a tavern, has altered interactions with alcoholics, and also has a chance of not being killed by the last hit, the chance is 10% * luck)
}
Buccaneer
{
Buccaneers were forest hunters from French settlers who settled in the early 17th century on islands in the Caribbean belonging to Spain. Buccaneers' favorite weapon - musket: a large, almost two-meter, heavy pistol. It was used for hunting wild boars, as well as when it was necessary to hit the helmsman on an enemy vessel from a distance of 250 m. The Buccaneers were excellent marksmen. They fired their muskets as they swam up to the ship, thereby making boarding easier for themselves.
(Stuns the enemy with a shot, causing them to lose 35% of energy, has a 10% chance of a critical hit with 130% damage, and also has a 25% acceleration in reloading guns)
}
Grunt
{
Long work in the forge hardens a man into steel, which he himself forges.
It is no wonder to understand that after long work, hands turn into strong weapon, which can greatly harm or injure any offenders.
(has 30 more energy, total damage from bladed weapon increased by 15%)
}
Agent
{
An undercover agent is not a job, it's a vocation. Serving the interests of the state or a private individual requires extraordinary abilities and skills.
The agent has no disadvantages or special advantages in his skills. It develops in a very balanced way.
(has a second chance at an excuse when detected by the enemy, altered interactions with alcoholics, all perks of flags and rags from the start, a double-enhanced feint with a 33% chance of criticism, as well as reduced prices for almost everything from a diplomat)
}
SeaWolf
{
Sea wolves, unlike most ordinary people, are especially good at what is most important in the Caribbean - in the maritime business. Their ship is always flying through the waves, their cannons do not know misfires and misses, and the crewg is always ready for any challenges.
(it has an increased team training speed, a 5% bonus to the ship's performance and a reduced chance of cannons exploding in battle and from wear)

Beaming with a white-toothed smile, she walks through life hand in hand with a friend-luck.

Rubaka Blaze is a descendant of the legendary Nicholas Sharp. However, in fact, even not quite a descendant - just an adopted son. Unlike his father, Blaze is less focused on great things - he is quite satisfied with the fun life of a pirate and adventurer. Naturally, great fame, untold wealth and a high position await him in the future. At least, he's sure of it himself. In the meantime, Blaze is a merry man and a regular at all the port taverns, the terror of the Spaniards and an indispensable participant in all the most scandalous pranks, risky adventures and drunken fights. Girls are pining for this daredevil, but not one has managed to attract his attention for a long time. The sea, mining and alcohol - that's what stirs Blaze's blood!

And the next offender is taken out, and Roger continues to carouse recklessly, occasionally posing for a visiting portrait painter... He categorically claims that it was from him that the famous pirate emblem was painted. I am very familiar with all the outstanding corsairs.

Juan, nicknamed "Phthisis", is a dirty pirate and swindler, as well as a slave trader from a gang of Barbary pirates operating in the waters of Morocco. The young Castilian showed up as a ruthless scoundrel who did not disdain anything for his own enrichment, even the slave trade. During the same period, for his deeds, Juan receives the nickname "Consumption", consonant with the name of a terrible disease that can torment its victim for years before finally finishing her off, which may well correspond to his character and methods.

Edward Teach was nicknamed "Blackbeard." His real name is John. Practically nothing is known about his childhood and youth, although there is a curious hypothesis that he was once a mercenary instructor, as evidenced by his first nickname "Teach" from the English word teacher - teacher. The captain had a way of braiding his beard into pigtails with ribbons and wrapping them around his ears. On the days of the battles, he just wore something like a scarf, the one that was draped over his shoulders with three pairs of pistols in cases like shoulder belts. He tied two lighted wicks under his hat, which hung from the right side and to the left of his face. All this, coupled with his eyes, whose view was naturally wild and cruel, made him so scary that it was unrealistic to imagine that even more terrible furies lived in hell.
