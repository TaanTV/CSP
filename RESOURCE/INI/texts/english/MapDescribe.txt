This is #sMapIslName#. The place of the hidden treasure is indicated on the map - this is #sMaplocName#. A famous pirate hid his treasure there.
The authenticity of the map is indicated by brown bloodstains, which also indicates the fact of repeated change of ownership of this piece of paper.

type_full_1
{
On the map #sMapIslName#. The place where the treasures are stored is #sMaplocName#. But whether they are there or not, you can only find out by checking.
The map is quite ancient and there is no doubt about its authenticity.
}
type_full_1_isl {island}
type_full_1_mein {mainland}
type_full_2
{
The map is clearly fresh and the paper has not had time to turn yellow. If you believe the notation on it, then the treasure is hidden in the place #sMaplocName# on #sMapIslName#. Will it be there? I need to check it out!

type_full_2_mein {mainland}
type_quest_0
{
This is #sMapIslName#. The place of the hidden treasure is indicated on the map - this is #sMaplocName#. That's where #sMapOwner# hid his treasure.
The authenticity of the map is indicated by brown bloodstains, which also indicates the fact of repeated change of ownership of this piece of paper.

type_part
{
This is one of the parts of the map that obviously leads to the treasure. It is not yet possible to find out exactly where they are hidden, there is very little information on this flap. But it remains to be hoped that the second part of this card is stored somewhere and someday it will fall into my hands.
And then everything will become clear!
}
type_fake
{
This is a map that obviously leads to the treasure. It is possible to find out exactly where they are hidden, but only this is an obvious fake.
You just need to throw away this piece of paper.
