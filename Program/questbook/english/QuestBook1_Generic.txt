#QUEST Findship

Ship Search

#TEXT 1

The head of the shipyard @<sCity> named @<sName> asked for help to find him a new vessel. One of his customers needs @<sShip>. The characteristics and condition of the ship are not important. The main thing is to deliver the ship of this type itself, and no later than two months. If successful, my fee will be one and a half times the sale price of the ship.

#TEXT 2

I was unable to find the required vessel on time. The task has failed.

#TEXT 3

The right ship has been found and delivered to the customer, a reward in the amount of @<sMoney> has been received.

#QUEST CursedSkeleton

Cursed captain

#TEXT 1

In the cave, I met@<sSex> an intimidating-looking skeleton, who demanded that I send @<sSex1> to the colony of @<scityName> and get@<sSex> a crystal skull for him. Better hurry up.

#TEXT 2

The job is done, I have the skull. Now I can take a break. I'll rent a room in a tavern.


#QUEST ShipOrder

Custom Ship

#TEXT t1

@<sName>, the head of the shipyard @<cityName>, agreed to build for me a @<sShipType> with characteristics to my taste. The work had to be paid in full in advance: @<money> gold. @<sName> warned that he would not return the advance if I changed my mind. The ship will be ready in @<time> days. @<TuningMaterial>

#TEXT t2

For shipmaster from @<cityName2>, it's left to bring: @<TuningMaterial2>.

#TEXT End

I have the ship. All the characteristics are exactly what they were promised. It's time to try it out.

#TEXT Lose

I refused@<sSex> the ordered ship. The money paid for its construction is irretrievably lost.


#QUEST BurntShipQuest

Burnt-out ship in @<cityName>

#TEXT 1

The head of the port authority @<portmanName> from @<cityName> suggested that I find an extraordinary vessel with a certain characteristic @<text>. He promised a substantial reward. I have six months of time.

#TEXT 2

Well, the head of the port authority @<portmanName> solved all the problems himself. I don't think he was in trouble.

#TEXT 3

The head of the port authority was not so simple and gave the insurance money to the usurer. Well, I still have the ship. Let's see how it ends.

#TEXT 4

I received@<sSex> an award for a unique vessel. Whole @<money> gold coins. For that kind of money, I can buy two similar ships. I must pay tribute - the head of the port authority knows his business and knows how to talk with insurers.

#TEXT 5

I decided@<sSex> to keep the ship for myself. It seemed to me that @<money> gold is too little for such a luxurious boat.


#QUEST GiveShipLetters

Documents found

#TEXT 1

A curious find! Someone was so distracted, or maybe in a hurry to get away, that he dropped a full set of ship's documents. I am sure@<sSex>, the owner will report the loss soon.

#TEXT 2

Well, it was quite easy for me to provide a service to nice people.

#TEXT 3

Well, the world is not without kind people. It's good that the owner will soon receive the loss!

#TEXT 4

Well, the world is not without kind people. I had a good look@<sSex> at the shipyard!

#TEXT 5

The income was quite small, but there were no worries either.

#TEXT 6

Perhaps it would be better this way. The income may not be great, but now the documents are not my concern.

#TEXT 7

It's nice when a product and a merchant find each other so well!

#TEXT 8

It's nice when the service is fully rewarded!

#TEXT 9

According to the deeds, it will be rewarded! The documents will soon find the owner, and the money has already found my pocket.

#TEXT 10

It was necessary to hand over the papers earlier, perhaps the owner would not have to correct new documents.


#QUEST PrisonGun

Guns for the fort

#TEXT   1

The commandant of the fort @<sCity>, @<sName>, suggested that I assemble @<sText> in the amount of @<sQty> pieces to replace the coastal battery. I set a condition - the entire batch as a whole and not earlier than in a month. I agreed with@<sSex>, considering that he is willing to pay for it with @<sSum> piastres.

#TEXT   2

The guns were delivered, the payment was received - however, not in cash, but in credit chests, but I was quite satisfied with that. And the commandant, I'm sure@<sSex>, was not at a disadvantage.

#TEXT   3

What a misfortune! The commandant refused to buy back the guns. Where should I put this pile of cast iron now? Except to sell it to the shipyard for a song...

#TEXT   4

I took too long@<sSex> searching for guns and @<sName> bought them elsewhere. I should have been quicker...


#QUEST ReasonToFast

Reason for haste

#TEXT 1

A pretty girl blabbed that the garrison officer was in such a hurry to go to some bay that it prevented his amorous pleasures.

Maybe it's worth investigating what's going on?

#TEXT 2

Are there not enough chatterboxes in the world? Maybe I just imagined@<sSex> too much for myself?

#TEXT 3

Apparently, I gave in to@<sSex> the mood of an offended girl. I probably shouldn't have thought of anything...

#TEXT 4

What a misfortune! This guy appeared very inappropriately. It's too late to guess what they were up to now...

#TEXT 5

It turns out that a pirate messenger was following me. That's exactly what the patrolman was waiting for here. But I think I managed to impersonate the messenger @<sName>.

#TEXT 6

I tracked down a corrupt patrol sergeant and became convinced of his connections with the pirate leader. Unfortunately, it was not possible to arrest him.

But he suffered the punishment he deserved.

#TEXT 7

I didn't get a chance to talk to the patrol officer. And to hell with it!...

#TEXT 8

What a misfortune! The patrol sergeant died, and the secret was lost with him...

#TEXT 9

The servant Judas is trying to get his 30 pieces of silver. I wonder what kind of service can cost such a bunch of @<sText>?

#TEXT 10

A dubious deal! But it's not for nothing that @<sName> hunted for this map?

#TEXT 11

@<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' with cargo @<sGoodsName> hanging out in the water area without protection. Useful information...

#TEXT 12

Does the governor keep valuables in his own boudoir? Oh, how careless....

#TEXT 13

thank god! I got@<sSex> out of this mess!

#TEXT 14

A good blade as a reward is always a pleasure! I should also check whether the received card is worth a whole handful of gems!

#TEXT 15

I got a pirate card. I should check as soon as possible whether it is worth the money spent!

#TEXT 16

Ooh... That's how faith in justice can turn into big trouble... I was almost suspected of attacking a patrol unit...

#TEXT 17

I chose@<sSex> from this opportunity, and it looks like a profit!

#TEXT 18

The patrolman's tip turned out to be correct! The luxury prize will more than cover my expenses.

#TEXT 19

How awkward it all turned out. I was unable to use the information I received for a lot of money.

#TEXT 20

I had to give up @<sText> in order not to hear the hot breathing of @<sName> behind my back. I'll be more careful about getting involved in this kind of adventure next time.

#TEXT 21

@<sName> does not want to part with @<sText> so easily. I need to get out of here as soon as possible.

#TEXT 22

It turns out that the pirates found out about the patrol officer's blunder. Well, so much the worse for him, he's probably already dead, and it's time for me to get out of here...

There doesn't seem to be anyone else to report my antics to @<sName>...

#TEXT 23

The pirates knew that I had the @<sName> card. They even knew which island he had hidden the treasure on. It's good that they have much less intelligence than greed, and they didn't manage to find the treasure before me.

#TEXT 24

Given the too unequal forces, I had to give the treasure to the treasure hunters @<sName>. I'll be more careful about getting involved in such adventures next time.

#TEXT 25

I managed to sink a pirate ship, from which this operation was carried out with a patrol officer. The patrolman himself is probably already dead - pirates do not forgive such mistakes... Well, there doesn't seem to be anyone else to report my antics to @<sName>.

#TEXT 26

I managed to get away with this story with the patrolman. I don't think pirates will haunt me forever. They probably have other things to do.


#QUEST PiratesOnUninhabited

@<shoreName>

#TEXT 1

@<shoreName> I took on board @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. They are asked to deliver them to any inhabited bay. Well, it's understandable - who is friendly with the law now?..

#TEXT 2

I delivered the@<sSex> wrecked pirates to @<toShore>. And even got@<sSex> a small reward. Of course it's a small thing, but it's nice...

#TEXT 3

I delivered@<sSex> pirates from a desert island @<toShore>. But these scoundrels also demanded to lend them money. I had to explain that I don't lend money...

#TEXT 4

I delivered@<sSex> pirates from a desert island @<toShore>. And I even lent@<sSex> some money to them... It's hard to imagine how I myself would@<sSex> choose@<sSex1> if I got into such a situation.

#TEXT 5

@<shoreName> I took on board @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. They are asked to deliver them to any inhabited bay in return for a treasure map. Well, let's see what kind of map it is... Or just hand them over to the authorities? At least the profit will be guaranteed...

#TEXT 6

The rascal decided to cheat me. But he had to pay for it in full.

#TEXT 7

The rascal didn't have a map, but he told me where captain @<capName> hides his loot. I will need to visit @<toShore>.

#TEXT 8

I don't know if there was a treasure @<shore>. I couldn't find him. And God be with him, I didn't spend much.@<sSex>.

#TEXT 9

The pirate was right. In @<shore> I found really good treasure.

#TEXT 10

And this pirate is very difficult. As it turned out, he did not promise the treasure to me alone@<sSex>. But I still got it.

#TEXT 11

@<shoreName> I have taken on board @<count> sailors who were landed by captain of @<pirateName>. I need to get them to some inhabited bay. Or just hand it over to the authorities?..

#TEXT 12

I decided@<sSex> that it was better to have a tit in my hands and handed over the pirates to the governor @<mayorName>. I think it's more correct. At least the piastres are already jingling in my pockets.

#TEXT 13

@<shoreName> I took on board @<count> sailors who were landed by captain @<badCapName>. They claim that this pirate goes to @<ship> and trades in the slave trade. I agreed to find him. If I'm lucky, I'll get the contents of the hold, and they'll get the ship.

#TEXT 14

I boarded@<sSex> @<ship>, and there was indeed a batch of slaves in its hold. Well, friendship with pirates, it turns out, is sometimes useful too...

#TEXT 15

I had to drown the @<ship>, and at the same time put an end to the pirates. I think few people will be upset about this.

#TEXT 16

In the heat of battle, I drowned@<sSex> @<ship>. I had to compensate the pirates for its cost. I can't leave them without a livelihood, so to speak.


#QUEST ShipWrecked

Castaways

#TEXT 1

@<ShoreName> I took on board @<count> sailors from the wrecked @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>'. They must be delivered to any settlement @<sNation>.

#TEXT 2

@<ShoreName> I took on board @<count> sailors who were landed by a pirate @<sBadName>. They must be delivered to any settlement @<sNation>.

#TEXT 4

@<ShoreName> I have taken on board @<count> sailors landed by the pirate @<sBadName>. They must be delivered to any nearby settlement.

#TEXT 5

@<ShoreName> I met@<sSex> @<count> sailors from the shipwrecked @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>'. Their captain is a little out of his mind and demands to be taken to Dunkirk... I don't know what to do with them. So far, I've taken@<sSex> everyone on board, so don't leave them in this deserted place.

#TEXT 6

I delivered@<sSex> Captain @<sName> and his sailors to @<sCity>. And even got@<sSex> a small reward. Of course it's a small thing, but it's nice...

#TEXT 7

This crazy victim demands to be taken to Dunkirk and flatly refuses to leave the ship! His arrogance is becoming unbearable!.. I don't know how to get out of this situation..

#TEXT 8

This psycho finally asked for a knife. I simply had no other choice. He talked about some untold treasures, but he didn't even have a spoon. What a rascal!..

#TEXT 9

I finally managed to get rid of this victim. He even handed me a piece of a map. I need to get out of here as soon as possible before he realizes that I cheated on him@<sSex>. Hehe... Dunke-erk, Dunke-erk...

#TEXT 10

@<ShoreName> I met@<sSex> shipwrecked sailors. I will need to report them to the governor of the nearest settlement @<sNation>. I think the food he left will be enough until the expedition ship arrives.

#TEXT 11

@<ShoreName> I met@<sSex> sailors who were landed by the pirate @<sBadName>. I will need to report them to the governor of the nearest settlement @<sNation>. I think the food he left will be enough until the expedition ship arrives.

#TEXT 12

Business did not allow me to return to this ill-fated bay. It remains to be hoped that the unfortunate sailors were picked up by one of our fellow captains...

#TEXT 13

I informed@<sSex> Governor @<sCity> too late about the sailors left by me @<ShoreName>. I can only pray to the Lord that help will arrive in time...

#TEXT 14

I informed@<sSex> Governor @<sCity> about the sailors left by me @<ShoreName>. For which he even received@<sSex> a small reward. The governor was very glad that captain of the lost ship managed to survive. He hastily organizes a rescue expedition.

#TEXT 15

I delivered@<sSex> Captain @<sName> and his sailors to the nearest settlement. And I got@<sSex> is a very worthy gift, although it did not require a reward...

#TEXT 16

@<ShoreName> I have taken on board captain @<sName> and @<count> of his sailors. The captain claims that the pirate @<sBadName>, having incited the crew to mutiny, took away his ship and landed the unfortunate people on shore. I promised captain to find and return his ship '@<ShipName>', and I will get the hold.

#TEXT 17

As agreed, I delivered captain and the sailors from his team to the settlement. I received nothing but gratitude for this@<sSex>, but it didn't cost me anything...

#TEXT 18

I boarded@<sSex> @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>' and, according to our agreement, gave@<sSex> his @<sName>, after clearing the hold. Justice has been served.

#TEXT 19

During the battle, @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>' sank, and with it the contents of the hold went down. It was very uncomfortable in front of captain @<sName>. But there is nothing to be done.


#QUEST JungleGirl

Girl in the jungle

#TEXT 1

I promised@<sSex> @<sName> from the settlement of @<sCity> to bring @<sText1> large and @<sText2> small pearls for her mistress's necklace. I need to try to make it in 10 days, otherwise the work may be in vain.

#TEXT 2

In exchange for the pearls, I received@<sSex> from @<sName> is a very good amulet. That's it, I never know where I'll find it, where I'll lose it.

#TEXT 3

I did not manage to collect enough pearls for@<sSex>. It's a pity, of course, for the girl, but there's nothing to be done - there was nothing to hire such a capricious hostess...

#TEXT 4

@<sName> said she knows where the treasures of her father, the famous pirate @<sPirateName>, are hidden. This is @<sTreasureLoc>. I need to land at @<sShore>. After mining the treasure, it will have to be delivered back to the settlement @<sCity>.

#TEXT 5

@<sName> is dead, and I do not know the place where the chests are hidden... It's a pity, but I was unlucky this time.

#TEXT 5_1

I didn't@<sSex> get involved with Daddy's treasure hunt @<sName>. Let her sort out her treasure by herself.

#TEXT 6

There was a whole bunch of treasures in the @<sPirateName> treasure, I got@<sSex> half. Now I need to take @<sName> home to the settlement of @<sCity>.

#TEXT 7

@<sName> is dead... It's a pity for the girl, she just got rich and such a ridiculous death.

#TEXT 8

I brought@<sSex> @<sName> home with her treasures. As a token of gratitude, she gave me a nice present... Still, it's damn nice to make people happy.

#TEXT 9

The daughter of @<sText>, who is in the settlement of @<sCity>, ran away from home. He claims that he does not want to marry the son of a usurer and begs to take him to the chosen one @<sLover>. What should I do with it? "I don't know. And I don't want to spoil the girl's life, and I feel sorry for my parents...

#TEXT 10

@<sName> is dead. This is what disobedience to parents leads to...

#TEXT 11

I handed over the@<sSex> fugitive to the guards. Let them figure out where to put it...

#TEXT 12

In the settlement of @<sCity>, the girl ran away from me too. Well, I hope she finds her happiness, for which she is ready to sacrifice everything. Oh, youth...

#TEXT 13

I took@<sSex> the fugitive to her father, I think it's right. What could be worse than the grief of parents who have lost their child? Her father confirmed this with a generous reward.

#TEXT 14

I took the@<sSex> girl to her lover. Then let them figure it out for themselves, I'm not their babysitter.

#TEXT 15

I took@<sSex> to take the lovers to the settlement of @<sCity> to the parents of the newly-made groom. I think this is the right decision.

#TEXT 16

I delivered@<sSex> a couple in love, where I promised@<sSex>. I will need to go to @<sText> and get the payment from the groom's father. I wonder how glad he'll be to see me.

#TEXT 17

I didn't@<sSex> to bother the groom's parents, they have enough worries now without me. And my expenses in this enterprise were quite small.

#TEXT 18

The young man's father thanked me generously and made a substantial gift... Oh, I sincerely envy this couple.

#TEXT 19

I shouldn't have gone to this miser. It's a pity for the young ones - neither one nor the other was lucky with their parents... The people are completely stale in this hole, they don't want to understand anything except gold. But I am glad@<sSex1> that I was able to@<sSex1> help this couple, even if they live differently.

#TEXT 20

I took@<sSex> to take a girl who escaped from a brothel @<sBrothelCity> to her parents in the settlement of @<sCity>.

#TEXT 21

I took@<sSex> to bring the suitcase of the escaped from the brothel @<sName>. I need to look for him in the dating room. There's some money, documents, a decent dress and other belongings of the poor thing.

#TEXT 22

Business made me leave the girl at the tavern. I think she's smart enough to get herself out of this situation.

#TEXT 23

Everything that@<sSex> could do, I did@<sSex1>. All that remains is to wish @<sName> a successful trip home.

#TEXT 24

I delivered@<sSex> @<sName> to the settlement of @<sCity>. He did not accompany her to her parents@<sSex>, they won't be up to me right now...

#TEXT 25

I delivered @<sName> home. In gratitude, they gave me a good blade. In addition, I received deep moral satisfaction.

#TEXT 26

I delivered @<sName> home. In gratitude, they gave me an excellent musket. In addition, I received deep moral satisfaction.

#TEXT 27

I delivered @<sName> home. The enterprising brother of the fugitive offered a joint raid against the pirates, but I had to refuse.


#QUEST ShipEpidemy

Epidemic on the ship

#TEXT 1

I think I caught it.@<sSex> infection, apparently captain of the ship '@<sShipName>' was not joking about the epidemic. I need to communicate less with the team and continue to be more careful in such cases.

#TEXT 2

The crisis of the disease has passed. My appetite has returned, so, thanks to God's grace, I are on the mend.

#TEXT 3

There's an epidemic on board. Sailors are dying of disease. The captain of the boarding ship '@<sShipName>', damn him along with his ship and goods, was not joking at all... What should I do now?.. May the Blessed Virgin Mary save us.

#TEXT 4

The disease has receded. Glory to the Most Holy Theotokos!.. From now on, I need to be more careful in such cases...


#QUEST ChurchGenQuest1

Return the priest's manuscripts @<sCity>

#TEXT	1

Father @<sName> gave me an assignment: to bring precious theological manuscripts that he gave to the priest @<sOwnerCity> for the purpose of education (and by order of higher authorities) and not returned on time. I took@<sSex> to help solve this delicate problem.

#TEXT 2

Adults, servants of the Lord- but as children, by God. Well, anyway, the main thing is that I have the manuscripts! Now I need to take them back to @<sColony>.

#TEXT 3_1

I look at people and wonder! Everyone tries to hide their laziness and irresponsibility behind high intentions. How could I give such valuable things to an outsider completely without any guarantees? And a priest... Now chase this @<sCapName>, captain "@<sShipName>" all over the archipelago.

#TEXT 3_2

That's the problem: I'll have to look for a ship whose name I do not know. I must act immediately, before this God-fearing captain places precious books somewhere... and the first thing to do is to find out what is so SUBLIME that @<sCapName> wrote on board his vessel?

#TEXT 4

I wonder why I have to pay for someone's religious impulses?! A thousand gold pieces, damn it! I hope that around @<sColony> I will catch up with this tub of "@<sShipName>" with a God-fearing captain on the bridge and shake these pieces of paper out of him, for which the Lord may forgive me a couple of extra sins.

#TEXT 5

Failure again. But what a versatile man this @<sName> is, however: the priest trusts him so much that he has instructed him to deliver a valuable cargo, and port officials are shaking with hysteria at the very sound of his name. Let's see how things turn out when I finally meet at @<sColony>...

#TEXT 6

An interesting person, this captain. Well, it's time to meet him face to face, get the coveted books and deliver them to their rightful owner at @<sColony>.

#TEXT 7

Today I handed over@<sSex> to the priest @<sColony> his precious manuscripts and received@<sSex> a reward laced with a fervent warning against greed.

#TEXT 7_2

The old fool @<sCapName> owed money at the tavern for drinks and gave the innkeeper precious books and manuscripts as collateral. Expenses again: I will buy the manuscripts and finally deliver them to @<sColony>.

#TEXT 8

Another entry in the expense book: the debt of the old sperm whale under the name @<sName> in the tavern has been paid, the manuscripts of Father @<sColony> have been bought from the tavern keeper, and now it's time to show said Father and his beloved manuscripts and my expense book!

#TEXT 9

It turns out that there are disinterested tavern keepers in the world. I will hurry to @<sColony> to return the theological manuscripts, and also tell the story of how, in fulfillment of a vow, a man gave me these precious books for free.

#TEXT 10

Uff... I didn't think@<sSex> that such a simple task would take so much time and effort. I was only pleased with the God-fearing captain @<sCapName>, who without hesitation handed me precious manuscripts and almost kicked me out of his trough. It's time to go back to @<sColony>.


#QUEST ChurchGenQuest2

Church robbery @<sCity>

#TEXT	1

Steal the church cash register! Where is this world going?! While @<sName>'s father is casting curses on the heads of godless people, I should take more effective steps. For which, if not the Lord, then the padre will certainly reward me... Perhaps they couldn't have gone far...

#TEXT	2

There is a rumor in the city that some local bandits got hold of God's money, who also had the sense to lie low. I should visit their hunting grounds.

#TEXT	3

Truly, God gives everyone his own: the bandits got what they deserved, and I got the church treasury. It's time to visit the holy father.

#TEXT	4

That's how it would always be - and God pleased@<sSex>, and did not offend himself@<sSex>. Grace!

#TEXT	5

This is even more than I expected@<sSex>. After all, it's not so bad to run errands for the church!

#TEXT	6

Well, I'm cursed@<sSex> and rich@<sSex>. With that kind of money, I'm not even a brother to the devil.

#TEXT	7

The jungle is full of scum for every taste, but I still haven't found the ones I need. I'll go back to the city and try to find out more precisely where they might have gone.

#TEXT	8

The brave robbers of church goods turned out to be smarter than I thought@<sSex>, and took their feet out of the settlement. Rather, in @<sCity>, which is on @<sIsland>, before the rest of the coins flow into the clutches of city innkeepers and port whores!

#TEXT	9

My smugglers turned out to be compliant. They helped the scoundrels for money, and they were given out for money. It remains only to take a walk @<sShore>.

#TEXT	10_1

That's the story... Is @<sName>'s father really that treacherous? Still, I should talk to him before suspecting a possibly completely innocent person...

#TEXT	10_2

That's the story... Is @<sName>'s father really that treacherous? However, now that I've killed@<sSex> these scoundrels, no one except the padre himself will be able to either refute or confirm their words...

#TEXT	11_1

Well, finally I found scoundrels. Of course, @<sSex1> didn't get the Holy Grail, but still! It's time to go back.

#TEXT	11_2

I hope I have done a noble deed, and during the last judgment, the Almighty will credit me for sharing my property with the underprivileged in order to open the way for them to a righteous existence. By the way, it is necessary to please the holy Father that the church property seems to have gone for the same purpose...

#TEXT	11_3

Who would have thought that church supplies were so expensive... Well, at least I got something in exchange for money.@<sSex>. I'll take the cup to the padre, maybe it will ease his grief for the parish register.

#TEXT	11_4

There is no shame in being poor... It's a shame to lie!@<sSex> with anyone, from the king to the barber. And God rewarded such nobility: the scoundrels who insulted Him and me will now be defeated, the church property will be saved, and I will receive the reward due to me!

#TEXT	12_1

I want to believe that father's remorse was sincere. Of course, from a material point of view, I rendered@<sSex> at a loss, but what a moral satisfaction!

#TEXT	12_2

What a turn of events! It turns out that priests are no strangers to bouts of greed. But, as they say, everything that ends well is good. After all, @<sName>'s father managed to overcome the temptation and did not even forget to recoup my expenses.

#TEXT	12_3

What a turn of events! It turns out that priests are no strangers to bouts of greed. But still, @<sName>'s father managed to overcome the temptation. However, in his excitement he forgot to pay my expenses. I had to remind I...

#TEXT	12_4

In our greedy age, the Devil knows how to seduce even a church minister with the sound of gold, what can I say about ordinary people? It may look stupid, but I disdained@<sSex> the dirty money of a scoundrel in a cassock.

#TEXT	12_5

Truly, God is all-merciful if He allows sinners like Father @<sName> to deceive a trusting flock. I am not that good-natured@<sSex>, and I was@<sSex1> I would be glad to@<sSex1> hand over the fraudster to the authorities, but I have no solid evidence of collusion... I've had enough of exploits for the glory of God... It's already a good thing that I shook @<sSex2> out of this scoundrel for expenses.

#TEXT	12_6

Truly, God is all-merciful if He allows sinners like Father @<sName> to deceive a trusting flock. I am not that generous@<sSex>, and I was@<sSex1> I would be glad@<sSex1> to turn the fraudster over to the authorities, but I have no solid evidence of collusion... I've had enough of exploits for the glory of God - all expenses and disappointments...

#TEXT	12_7

I still haven't cleared@<sSex> of suspicions about @<sCity>'s father. Of course, the word of a priest means more than the word of a bandit, but this whole story smells bad. I've had enough of exploits for the glory of God – all expenses and disappointment...

#TEXT	12_8

The Holy Father adequately withstood the news that the church money went to the robbers to drink. Let him be comforted that my expenses did not pay off either.

#TEXT	12_9

Of course, I did@<sSex> is not exactly Christian... but the parish will not be impoverished, and my expenses will be paid off at least partially. The main thing is that the church purse did not go to the vile thieves...

#TEXT	12_10

To appropriate the church cash register, and then also receive a reward for it, of course, is not the most virtuous act, but if I do not urgently change the rigging, one of the sailors may fall off and fall to his death, and this sin will fall on my soul... And as for the holy father, I vow someday to donate three times more to this church than I took@<sSex>!

#TEXT	12_11

Will the Lord forgive me, who alone knows why I betrayed the trust of a simple-minded priest?.. I had already committed a sin, but it would have been even worse to accept the money with which, in his infinite kindness, he wanted to comfort me.

#TEXT	12_12

No money! No glory!! Yes, and vile suspicions about me!!! So that I can once again connect@<sSex> with the saints!!

#TEXT	13

The Bible says that God gives everyone a test according to their abilities... However, my strength seems to have been exhausted, and this cross is not up to me. I hope @<sName>'s father will understand me when I tell him that I could not@<sSex> complete his task.

Captain's last words

#TEXT	1

Before his death, Captain @<sShipName> @<sCapName> asked me to tell @<sCharName> from the settlement @<sCity> that I did not have time to complete his assignment. I will need to find this person. After all, the last will of a dying man and all that...

#TEXT	2

I didn't@<sSex> wasting time on trifles. The petitioner must have forgotten his errand long ago.

#TEXT	3

@<sCharName> suggested that I deal with the ransom of my prisoner @<sCharType>. I did not take@<sSex> for this case, citing my busy schedule.

#TEXT	4

@<sCharName> from @<sCity> asked me to deliver 150,000 gold @<sPirateName> to @<sPirateCity> to return his @<sFamilyType> @<sSlaveName>, whom the pirates are holding for ransom. Upon my return, 40,000 gold pieces are waiting for me for my work.

#TEXT	5

I got into an unpleasant situation@<sSex>. It turns out that captain @<sCapName> was carrying @<sPirateName> to @<sPirateCity> a ransom for some prisoner @<sSlaveName> - 3 chests of gold. This type, @<sCharName>, categorically made it clear to me that the order remains in force. If I don't bring @<sSlaveName> to the @<sCity> tavern in 30 days, I promised to send hunters after me... But how could I@<sSex1> not find these chests in the cabin of the late captain?!

#TEXT	6

I failed@<sSex1> execute the assignment @<sCharName>. Of course it's@<sSex>, but let him forgive me. After all, I could have @<sSex2> died the same way as captain @<sCapName>.

#TEXT	7

Well, the time allotted for the prisoner's delivery is over. Let's see what the formidable Mr. @<sCharName> will do now.

#TEXT	8

I decided@<sSex> to refuse to complete the task @<sCharName>. Maybe he was offended, but I returned the money to him@<sSex>.

#TEXT	9

I took the@<sSex> prisoner. Now it remains to deliver it to the customer @<sCharName> in @<sCity>.

#TEXT	10

@<sName>, without waiting for a ransom, sold his prisoner on a plantation in Barbados. Well, that's for the best, a simple slave won't be worth it as a hostage. I must hurry to Barbados to see Colonel Bishop.

#TEXT	11

I paid@<sSex> for @<sName> @<sSum> gold. Now I need to hurry to @<sCity> to @<sCharName>. He's probably worried, poor guy. And it wouldn't hurt to get a reward.

#TEXT	12

The mistake with the trunks cost me dearly. I paid@<sSex> for @<sName> whole @<sSum> gold. But this prisoner turned out to be not at all simple and offered me to take him to @<sCity> in exchange for some valuable information. I agreed with @<sSex1>, especially since the customer does not seem to intend to pay at all.

#TEXT	13

The mistake with the trunks cost me dearly. I paid@<sSex> for @<sName> whole @<sSum> gold. It seems that the released one is not eager to meet with the customer, but that's not my business. I don't want to get in trouble for some poor bastard.

#TEXT	14

I delivered@<sSex> a former hostage, and now a free citizen @<sName> to his relative, for which I received@<sSex> promised reward of 40,000 gold in three credit chests.

#TEXT	15

I delivered the@<sSex> former hostage @<sName> to his relative. But the latter refused to compensate for the additional costs... How uncooperative people become when they don't need anything from I anymore.

#TEXT	16

I delivered the@<sSex> former prisoner to the customer. As it turned out, this is the @<sSpeciality> specialist that @<sNation> was after. As a reward, I was even given a valuable gift on behalf of the government.

#TEXT	17

During the escape, @<sName> died. I probably shouldn't have put him through such a test. What am I going to tell the customer now?

#TEXT 	17_1

@<sName> died in the jungle. I probably shouldn't have put him through such a test. What am I going to tell the customer now?

#TEXT	18

I managed to organize the escape of @<sName> from the plantations. It remains to find him and deliver him alive to the customer.

#TEXT	19

This prisoner turned out to be not at all simple and offered me to take him to @<sCity> in exchange for some valuable information. I agreed, especially since the customer does not seem to intend to pay at all.

#TEXT	20

It seems that the released one is not eager to meet with the customer, but that's not my business. I don't want to get in trouble for some poor bastard.

#TEXT	21

This captured engineer turned out to be very useful. It is difficult to overestimate the importance of the information received from him, even for a sophisticated soldier.

#TEXT	22

I informed@<sSex> @<sCharName> about the death of his relative @<sName>. I kept the money that he gave to the pirates for myself as compensation for expenses.

#TEXT	23

I informed@<sSex> @<sCharName> about the death of his relative @<sName> and returned to@<sSex> the 150,000 gold received from him to pay the deposit. It was possible, of course, to demand compensation for expenses, but not in this case.

#TEXT	24

@<sName> instructed me to sink two pirate ships '@<sShipName1>' and '@<sShipName2>', which went to @<sShoreName>, which is on @<sShoreType>. I need to make it in 15 days before they clear the cache.

#TEXT	25

The @<sName> assignment has been completed, '@<sShipName1>' and '@<sShipName2>' have been destroyed. Now I need to hurry to @<sCity> before @<sNameNom> sells the prisoner to slavers.

#TEXT	26

I didn't have time to catch up with the pirates. They've probably already cleaned out the cache. I'll have to go back to @<sName> with nothing.

#TEXT	27

I couldn't come to an agreement with@<sSex>. Now I don't even know if it's worth going back to @<sCity> to @<sCharName>. What am I going to tell him?

#TEXT	28

After my mistake with the task, @<sName> increased the ransom amount to 200,000 gold. I didn't@<sSex> lay out your money. Now I don't even know if it's worth going back to @<sCity> to @<sCharName>. What am I going to tell him?

#TEXT	29

After my mistake with the task, @<sName> increased the ransom amount to 200,000 gold. I had to lay out my money. Now I need to hurry to @<sCity> to @<sCharName>. Maybe the customer will compensate my expenses after all?

#TEXT	30

I didn't@<sSex> pay that kind of money. It's one thing to ransom a hostage, and quite another to buy a slave on a plantation... I wonder if Bishop has increased security after the famous events or is still saving money?

#TEXT	31

@<sName> does not want to give up his prisoner without ransom. Well, I'll have to look for money or spit on this assignment.

#TEXT	32

I told@<sSex> @<sName> about the death of the prisoner. It seems that he is now in the same hopeless position that he recently put me in.

#TEXT	33

I was unable to@<sSex> destroy the pirate ships @<sShipName1> and @<sShipName2>. I'll have to go back to @<sName> with nothing.

#TEXT 	34

Finally, @<sName is on board. Now I need to hurry to @<sCity> to @<sCharName>. Until he had a stroke.

Captain's last words

#TEXT	1

Before his death, Captain @<sName> asked me to tell Captain @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' @<sCapName> that he was going to be arrested at @<sCity1>. The authorities found out about something there... @<sShipTypeNom> is sailing from @<sCity2> and will anchor in port @<sCity11> in 10-15 days. I must try to make it in time. After all, the last will of a dying man and all that...

#TEXT	2

Business did not allow me to warn Captain @<sCapName> about the danger that threatened him. I think he'll get out on his own, if he has a head on his shoulders.

#TEXT	3

I did@<sSex> the order of captain @<sName>, but I did not help his friend@<sSex>, referring to employment. He's a smart guy and he'll figure out his own problems.

#TEXT	4

Captain @<sName> asked me to help him smuggle the cargo of @<sGoods> out of @<sShoreName>. And when I refused@<sSex>, he took my boat and threw me out on a deserted beach like a kitten. I'll have to start all over again... That's how I help people.

#TEXT	5

Captain @<sName> asked me to help him smuggle the cargo of @<sGoods> out of @<sShoreName>. And when I refused@<sSex> from this dubious event, I tried to take away my ship. He shouldn't have started it, I had to let him go to the bottom. I wish I knew where the stash was.

#TEXT	6

Captain @<sName> asked me to help him smuggle the cargo of @<sGoods> out of @<sShoreName>. And when I refused@<sSex> from this dubious event, I tried to take away my ship. I had to leave with all sails.

#TEXT	7

Captain @<sName> asked me to help smuggle the cargo of @<sGoods> out of @<sShoreName>. I'll get everything that won't fit in his hold... I will need to dock @<sShoreNameDat> right after midnight.

#TEXT	8

I have changed my mind@<sSex> to deal with Captain's questions @<sName>. Let him sort out the mess he's made himself.

#TEXT	9

It looks like an ambush was organized by @<sShoreName>, the patrolmen appeared too quickly. The captain @<sName> died in the fight. The sailors combed the entire bay, but they did not find the hiding place. Perhaps the authorities have already taken out all the cargo...

#TEXT	10

The goods are in the holds. I got @<sGoodsQuantity> pcs. @<sGoods>. Now captain and I are going our separate ways. I need to leave quickly before the authorities organize a chase.

#TEXT	11

The goods are in the holds. I got @<sGoodsQuantity> pcs. @<sGoods>. The captain @<sName> is afraid of being chased and asks to escort his ship to @<sShoreName>, which is on @<sShoreType>. I decided to help him, especially since he promises a solid reward in gold.

#TEXT	12

A patrol squadron was already waiting for us at the exit of the bay. I had to take the fight. @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' with a full hold @<sGoods> sank, and with it captain @<sName>.

#TEXT	13

I joined the battle and @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' sank with a full hold of @<sGoods>... Well, it's God's will. The brave Captain @<sName> I never had time to take advantage of the wealth that turned up so well...

#TEXT	14

Captain @<sName> and I decided that it was better for us to separate, so as not to bind each other with unnecessary obligations. He went to @<sShoreName>, and I went on about my business.

#TEXT	15

I did not manage to@<sSex1> escort @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' on time, and captain @<sName> refused to pay the reward. But I didn't lose out.@<sSex>.

#TEXT	16

The captain @<sName> lured me into a trap and demanded to return the cargo or pay off with gold. @<sShoreName> a part of his heroic team was waiting for us. I had to take the fight.

#TEXT	17

The captain @<sName> lured me into a trap and demanded to return the cargo or pay off with gold. @<sShoreName> a part of his heroic team was waiting for us. I had to put out @<sSum> gold.

#TEXT	18

It turns out that captain of the patrol @<sShipType> @<sName> is associated with smugglers. Maybe I should visit him in the fort's casemates?

#TEXT	19

It turns out that captain of the patrol @<sShipType> @<sName> is involved in a bad story with some missing cargo. Maybe I should visit him in the fort's casemates?

#TEXT	20

I couldn't find Captain @<sName>'s hiding place. I think it's not worth bothering the governor about this @<sCity>.

#TEXT	21

Captain @<sName> agreed to show me the cache in exchange for half of its contents. First I need to hide the fugitive on board your ship, then everything else.

#TEXT	22

Captain @<sName> died, and with him the hope of finding a hiding place.

#TEXT	23

I so stupidly failed@<sSex> the governor's order... God, it's a shame...

#TEXT	24

Captain's hiding place @<sName> @<sShoreName>. I need to prepare the hold to accommodate @<sGoodsQuantity> pcs. @<sGoods>. I must hurry before the cache is found.

#TEXT	25

I missed it so badly.@<sSex> Captain @<sName>! But it was possible to earn good money.

#TEXT	26

I found a stash, @<sGoodsQuantity> pcs. @<sGoods> loaded into the hold. Of these, @<sSum1> belongs to captain @<sName>. In @<sDays> days, it must be delivered to @<sShoreName>, which is on @<sShoreType>. Now let the governor's bloodhounds try to find Captain @<sName> and his precious goods, and for one thing let them add me to the list.

#TEXT	27

Finally, Captain @<sName> opened his hiding place, but I thought@<sSex> that there was no need to share it with him. He tried to challenge this decision, for which he paid the price. But @<sGoodsQuantity> pieces of @<sGoods> now belong to me.

#TEXT	28

Finally, Captain @<sName> opened his hiding place, but his nerves could not stand the news that I intend to transfer all the goods into the hands of the authorities. It was necessary to apply surgical intervention, as a result of which captain died. All that remains is to inform the governor of @<sCity> about the location of the cache.

#TEXT	29

I didn't@<sSex> inform the authorities about the location of captain's hiding place @<sName>. I think they'll find him without me.

#TEXT	30

The task of the governor @<sCity> has been completed. Instead of a monetary reward, I received@<sSex> is a very good gift.

#TEXT	31

I were late, there were no buyers for @<sShoreName>. The captain @<sName> offered to buy out his share, but there is no reason for me to throw money away for the goods that are already in my hold. Our dispute was decided by a duel.

#TEXT	32

I were late, there were no buyers for @<sShoreName>. The captain @<sName> offered to buy out his share for @<sSum> gold. I agreed@<sSex>, in gratitude captain gave me a nice gift. I parted as friends.

#TEXT	33

It looks like Captain @<sName> couldn't share the loot with his team. I had to reduce the number of people who wanted to get his share. And he didn't last long either. This means that our contract is no longer valid due to the death of one of the partners. I keep all the cargo.

#TEXT	34

It looks like Captain @<sName> couldn't share the loot with his team. I had to reduce the number of people who wanted to get his share. In addition, captain offered to buy her back for @<sSum> gold. I agreed@<sSex>, in gratitude captain gave me a nice gift. I parted as friends.

#TEXT	35

It looks like Captain @<sName> couldn't share the loot with his team. I had to reduce the number of people who wanted to get his share. In addition, captain offered to buy her back for @<sSum> gold. That's what I did@<sSex>. He also asked to join my team, but I refused@<sSex>. He's too independent.

#TEXT	36

It looks like Captain @<sName> couldn't share the loot with his team. I had to reduce the number of people who wanted to get his share. In addition, captain offered to buy her back for @<sSum> gold. That's what I did@<sSex>. Also, I hired@<sSex> as his officer. Everyone needs such fighters.

#TEXT	37

I was late@<sSex>, captain of the patrol @<sShipType> @<sName> was executed along with his team. I need to find out more about this case.

#TEXT	38

I was late@<sSex>, captain of the patrol @<sShipType> @<sName> was executed along with his team. But he could have managed to bring the contents of the hold to shore @<sShipTypeQuest>.

#TEXT	39

It turns out that everything is not so simple here. The captain of the patrol @<sShipType> @<sName> was executed along with part of the team, and there is no evidence of a crime. I would like to meet with the shell-shocked @<sCharName>, the former gunner of @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>'.

#TEXT	40

The former gunner @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' @<sName> told me the whole story of the death of @<sShipTypeQuest>'@<sShipNameQuest>'. But this shell-shocked man asked an exorbitant price for information about the cache. I didn't@<sSex> pay that kind of money.

#TEXT	41

The conversation with the former gunner @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' turned out to be very fruitful. I urgently need to find @<sSum> gold, this is the amount that @<sName> requested for information about the cache.

#TEXT	42

I changed my mind@<sSex> to deal with Captain's hiding place @<sName>. Let the former gunner @<sCharName> forgive me, but he asked for too much money, and I have more important things to do.

#TEXT	43

So, the former gunner @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' @<sName> told me the story of the death of @<sShipTypeQuest>'@<sShipNameQuest>'. It turns out that the cache really exists and the entire cargo is stored in it @<sShipTypeQuest> - @<sSum> pcs. @<sGoods>. I need to prepare the hold and come to @<sShoreName> after midnight, @<sName> will be waiting for me there.

#TEXT	44

I missed it so badly.@<sSex> a chance to clear captain's stash @<sName>! Maybe @<sCharName> didn't wait for me, or maybe he decided to cheat. In any case, it is a pity for the money and time spent...

#TEXT	45

The smugglers cleared captain's hiding place @<sName>. Or maybe it was @<sCharName> who decided to cheat me and worked on two fronts. In any case, it is a pity for the money and time spent...

#TEXT	46

The smugglers got to Captain @<sName>'s hiding place earlier. I had to fight off the load by force. It's a pity that the gunner @<sCharName> died. Ironically, all the members of the ill-fated @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' team are dead, and none of them were able to benefit from their heroic enterprise... I took@<sSex> all the goods that got into the hold - @<sSum> pcs. @<sGoods>.

#TEXT	47

#TEXT	48

I parted with the former gunner @<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' @<sCharName> at the port of @<sCity>. In gratitude, he gave me a nice valuable thing. At least one of the ill-fated @<sShipType> team benefited from their risky venture.

#TEXT	49

It turns out that captain of the patrol @<sShipType> @<sName> was arrested for robbery at sea. Maybe I should visit him in the fort's casemates?

#TEXT	50

The case is taking an interesting turn. It turns out that captain of the patrol @<sShipType> @<sName> has been arrested for robbery at sea, and the governor @<sCity> is looking for his hiding place.

The task of the @<ColonyName> governor has been completed. In the vicinity of @<sCity>, I managed to track down and destroy a gang of smugglers. I think the governor @<MayorName> will be pleased, I can go for a reward.

#TEXT   10

The governor of @<ColonyName> @<MayorName> instructed me to find and destroy a pirate ship engaged in plundering merchant ships in the surrounding waters. The task is not easy, I will have to search directly at sea and check everyone I meet.

This assignment must be completed in @<sDay>. The reward is determined in the amount of @<sMoney>.

#TEXT   11

The task of the @<ColonyName> governor has been completed, I managed to find and destroy @<ShipType>. I think the governor @<MayorName> will be pleased, I can go for a reward.

#TEXT   12

How, however, things turned out unpleasantly. Everything started so well, and ended in the bay @<Shore> so inglorious...

#TEXT   20

The task of the @<ColonyName> governor failed on time, I do not think that @<MayorName> will be pleased with this.

#TEXT   21

The task of the @<ColonyName> governor has failed. I managed to find the target, but I couldn't destroy it. @<MayorName> is very angry...

#TEXT   22

What the hell just happened? I must return to the governor for clarification...


#QUEST GivePrisonFree

Prison cases

#TEXT   1

I managed to free a prisoner named @<sName> from prison @<sCity>. I need to try to get him to the grotto on @<sIsland> alive, until then he will always be with me. In case of successful completion of the case, I will divide the treasure hidden on the island in half.

#TEXT   2

Failure! @<sName> is dead. Now I'm unlikely to get to his treasure...

#TEXT   3_1

I found the treasure that @<sName> was talking about and divided it equally. It's been a long time since I've seen such a pile of treasures!

#TEXT   3_2

I found the treasure that @<sName> was talking about and divided it equally. The cost of what I received will hardly cover my expenses for the expedition. The only consolation is that I found an ancient Indian artifact in the cache, which I got in excess of my share.

#TEXT   3_3

@<sName> tricked me to get freedom with my help. There was no treasure. Instead of treasures, @<sName> hid his combat gear here, which he gave to me for my efforts. Well, at least that's it.

#TEXT   3_4

There was no treasure. @<sName> used a piece of the treasure map, from which it is impossible to really understand where the treasure is, and, of course, he made the wrong island. I took this piece of paper to myself - I will try to find the missing fragment, and the treasure will go entirely to me.

#TEXT   4

It looks like @<sName> just tricked me. I didn't find any treasure. I need to be more discerning in your connections somehow.

#TEXT   5

I took@<sSex> to help a prison inmate @<sCity> named @<sName>. I need to talk to the head of the prison, maybe I can somehow resolve this issue.

#TEXT   6

The two days allotted to me have passed, and I have not been able to resolve the issue of the release of a prisoner named @<sName>. It's a pity, but he will have to stay in prison.

#TEXT   7

I was unable to free a prisoner named @<sName>. Well, anyway, I'll live without his treasure somehow.

#TEXT   8

In the prison @<sCity>, a prisoner named @<sName> asked me to deliver a thief's note to his friends in the city who are hiding in one of the houses. I agreed@<sSex>, I have the note. I have two days of time.

#TEXT   9

I was unable to deliver the note in the allotted time. The task failed on time.

#TEXT   10

I have successfully delivered a note to the friends of a prisoner named @<sName>. To my surprise, instead of a reward, they also tried to rob me. So trust the prisoners after that. I had to kill them all.

#TEXT   11

The deed is done, the thief's note has been delivered to the addressees. Out of the kindness of their hearts, the fraera unfastened my entire @<iMoney>. My happiness is immeasurable.

#TEXT   13

I managed to find out from the prisoner's friends on a safe basis that in the coming @<sDay> there will be two merchant ships off the coast of @<sShoreName> - '@<sShipName1>' and '@<sShipName2>', whose holds are full of @<sGoods>. I must try to intercept them.

#TEXT   13_1

I will arrive<sSex> on time! The ships '@<sShipName1>' and '@<sShipName2>' are within sight. Attack!

#TEXT   13_2

I was late@<sSex> and the merchant ships '@<sShipName1>' and '@<sShipName2>' have already gone somewhere unknown. Well, I'll be lucky another time...

#TEXT   14

I managed to find out from the prisoner's friends on a safe basis that in the coming @<sDay> a courier ship @<sText> called '@<sShipName>' carrying a large shipment of jewelry will be passing off the coast of @<sShoreName>. I must try to intercept him.

#TEXT   14_1

I will arrive<sSex> on time! The ship '@<sShipName>' is within sight. Attack!

#TEXT   14_2

I was late@<sSex> and the courier ship '@<sShipName>' has already gone somewhere unknown. Well, I'll be lucky another time...

#TEXT   15

I will arrive <sSex> on time, but I did not find any merchant ships '@<sShipName1>' and '@<sShipName2>' at the specified location@<sSex1>. The damned scoundrels deceived me-that's what it means to believe the scoundrels...

#TEXT   16

I have successfully delivered a note to the prisoner's friends. Instead of a reward, they offered to buy some information for a considerable sum. I refused@<sSex1> - their faces did not inspire confidence at all.

#TEXT   17

I successfully delivered a note to the prisoner's friends, but instead of a reward, they also robbed me. So trust the convicts after that...

#QUEST	ShipWreck

Shipwreck

#TEXT	1

As it turned out, the ship got caught in a storm and cannot continue its voyage. The owner of the ship "@<sShipName>" - @<sCharacter> asked me for a favor. For a completely normal fee in @<sMoney> gold, I need to deliver his person to any city. As far as I understand, they have to organize a rescue ship...

But one thought still haunts me - there is a certain cargo in the hold of this ship. It must be very valuable if captain is afraid to overload it in my hold. What if? If I take this cargo by force, my team is twice as large, I have a surprise factor. Of course, I will be @<sSex1>, but the sound of gold is much more pleasant than a crust of bread for lunch. I need to decide!

#TEXT	2

The decision was made - while the body of the messenger officer was being thrown overboard, I opened his envelope. What luck! The hold of this tub is literally filled with gold... I gave the order to approach@<sSex2>, the guns are loaded with a good share of grapeshot. Boarding will be easy, and the booty is royal!

#TEXT	3

The boarding party killed everyone. I had to personally kill this good-natured captain. And there was gold waiting for me in the hold of the ship. Of course, it won't be enough for old age, but it's still a good reward.

#TEXT	4

I have just dropped off a passenger at the port of one of the cities. I hope he finds the ship quickly.

#TEXT	5

The navigator of the ship, @<sNavigator>, met me on the deck. He claims that captain fell ill, and the ship was caught in a storm. I can hardly believe it. I noticed@<sSex2> blood on the deck, and the masts seemed to have been hacked with axes. Or maybe they were blown up by a small barrel of gunpowder. I don't know what happened on that damn ship, but I managed to@<sSex2> earn extra money. The stack of planks and canvas cost this rebel dearly. I hope the next patrol will sink this breeding ground of scum.

#TEXT	6

I hate rebels and traitors. A group of drunken scum raged on this ship for three days and slaughtered half of the crew. They paid for their rampage with their lives. I managed to save several members of the team, including captain.

#TEXT	7

I was met on deck by a team of mutineers led by a former navigator. I think I need thugs like that. And an extra ship wouldn't hurt. Having received the replenishment of the squadron, I sail on.

#TEXT	8

It turned out that there was a riot on this vessel. A group of losers led by some stupid bouncer cut the floor of the team and tried to dictate their terms to me. I quickly convinced@<sSex2> them, and these rats paid me a coin if only I would let@<sSex2> them live. I hope the nearest naval patrol will send this breeding ground of scum to the bottom.

#QUEST	QuestDuel

Duelist

#TEXT	1

At the port of @<sColony>, for @<sMoney> piastres, I agreed to@<sSex> help one of the townspeople named @<sName>. He asked me to defend his interests in a duel with a certain person. I'm not bad@<sSex1> swordsmen@<sSex2>, let's see what happens.

#TEXT	2

One of the townspeople of the city @<sColony> begged me to dissuade her husband named @<sName> from a duel. She was crying so hard that I couldn't refuse. Besides, I will be paid @<sMoney> piastres. And according to the lady, her husband does not own a sword at all. It's up to me!

#TEXT	3

I failed to dissuade my husband, and now I have to duel with the offender. I have agreed to provide my fencing services to@<sSex> and will act in place of that lady's husband.

#TEXT	4

The duel took place outside the city gates. The offender also used the services of a mercenary, who very safely went to his forefathers. I admit, he was a good swordsman, but he was far from me. I received@<sSex> money and I think to forget about this case.

#TEXT	5

The duel took place outside the city gates. I had to fight with the abuser himself. It's a pity for the man, he had a lot of courage. Thanks and money I received@<sSex> in full – now I'll try to forget about this case.

#TEXT	6

Unfortunately, this was not the end of the whole story. I was found by two young men at the corpse of the offender - as it turned out later, the nephews of the murdered man. Without giving me time to justify myself, they rushed at me with weapons in their hands. I had to@<sSex> was@<sSex> defending myself and... killed@<sSex> both. If I had only known@<sSex> at first that I would end the lives of three people of the same blood, I would not have taken @<sSex1> for this case for any money.

#TEXT	7

I've been stalling for too long and I'm too late for the duel. The task has failed.
