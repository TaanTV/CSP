THE COMBAT SYSTEM OF THE GAME

*

Masterly possession of a blade and a pistol will allow I to get out of any scrape alive. The combat system provides I with three types of attack strikes, two types of parry, block, one circular strike for defense and attack, the ability to fire a pistol, bounce back and to the sides.

*

life

A character's life is the amount of damage they can take. Life increases with each new level, and can also be increased by additional abilities.

During the battle, your life is displayed with a red stripe in the upper right corner, to the left of the character's portrait. I can replenish your life during the battle using bottles of elixirs ("healers") through the Enter menu/Use or hotkey.

*

health

Health is an indicator of the overall physical condition of the hero. The worse the health, the worse the hero's performance in the game becomes. Health deteriorates if the hero is injured a lot, and recovers if the hero does not participate in hand-to-hand combat for a long time. If it falls below excellent, the hero begins to receive disadvantages in characteristics, and those, in turn, give disadvantages in skills. Health is restored by itself, quite slowly, but still. The fastest is when the hero is doing nothing (sleeping in a tavern), twice as slow while sailing on a ship. The "Excellent Health" ability speeds up the recovery of health by half. The golden background of the health indicator indicates that health has recovered to the maximum. However, the maximum health can also decrease when receiving serious damage (scars and mutilations, which even after full healing make themselves felt in battle). Priests in churches can restore maximum health, but infrequently, not much and for a lot of money. Sometimes it takes 2-3 priests to visit in order for "good golden" health to become "good white" - and still after that I have to wait for health to restore itself to "excellent golden".

*

energy

A man cannot fight without stopping, eventually he will be overcome by fatigue. The amount of energy depends on the character's "Reaction" characteristic, the higher the value, the more the character is capable of.  Each blow consumes a certain amount of energy, so I should use your strength very carefully in battle. The amount of energy is displayed by a blue bar to the right of the character's portrait. If there is not enough energy, I will not be able to strike. Energy is gradually restored during combat, if I see that there is very little energy left and there is not enough for strikes - try to block or parry the blows of enemies until the energy is restored.  Additional abilities will help I use energy more economically on strikes and restore it faster.

*

ENERGY AND LIFE OF ENEMIES

During the battle, stripes with their life and energy will hang over the heads of your enemies. When I or your allies strike an enemy, a number will fly off his head showing the amount of damage inflicted on him.

***

TYPES OF STRIKES

A slashing blow is a slashing blow with a swing, inflicts medium damage, requires a little energy.

*

A stabbing blow is a quick blow that causes minor damage. It requires more energy than chopping, but at the expense of speed it allows I to interrupt the opponent's swing.

*

A punching blow requires a lot of energy, is applied on a large scale, slowly, but causes very great damage, and always breaks through the block.

*

A circular strike requires an average amount of energy and causes minor damage to all the characters standing around. The character who missed the roundabout staggers back slightly, freeing up room for the hero to maneuver, and gives a break for a counterattack.   *

*

Parrying allows I to parry a blow, taking the opponent's saber aside, does not require

Energy, saves from a punchy blow. With a successful parry, the opponent loses his rhythm and spends most of his energy.

*

A feint looks the same as a punch. If I feint and the opponent strikes a blow, your character will intercept his saber and strike back at him. Using a feint does not waste energy, and a successful deceptive strike with damage takes very little. A feint allows I to intercept a punching blow.

*

The block allows I to block all punches except the puncher. He doesn't waste energy. I can leave the block at any time, interrupting your attack if it is immediately obvious that it will be unsuccessful. The block can sometimes be broken through with ordinary punches if the opponent has the appropriate abilities.

*

A pistol shot causes damage to the enemy and causes that

Take a step back. Pistols come in different types and are one-, two- and four-shot, bullets are needed to shoot, reloading pistols in battle depends on the game setting and is performed only with the saber removed or not.

*

The rebound allows I to bounce two steps away from the enemy back or to the side, thereby removing the hero from under attack or from the thick of the battle.

*

SETTING UP BUTTONS FOR STROKES

To facilitate control, the game has a kick mode button, pressing it gives a second mode for the button. By default, stabbing and circular are on the same button – the left mouse button, punching and feint - the middle mouse button, chopping and parrying - the right mouse button. The block, shot and bounces are each on their own button.

MS Corsairs Ship Pack v2.2.0 (02.01.2022)

- The "Lost Player" fix

- Fixed car sales

- Fix options for hard conditions

- Fix of the exchange interface with the boarding ship

- Fix for the delivery of ships in Leyte

- Fix the usurer's dialogue according to the Spanish ruler

- Fix the loss of an excellent and GPC card in the chests of captains

- Fix alpha icons for square HUD

- Thomas Boyle's fix after the assassination of the Admiral in the CPC

- Fix on Isabella that the guards did not start a conspiracy after being accused of murdering her brother

> REMAKING THE DELIVERY OF SHIPS:

- Completely removed the dependence on the rank of the GG and the enemy. Dependence on boarding skills is already there, and the personal combat skills of the character do not logically solve much against the background of the team

- The dependence on the ship's class has been completely removed (as well as the ban on the surrender of first-class ships). A dozen people on tartan will be able to fight back exactly the same as on man

- The willingness to surrender depends on the complexity of the game - previously, addiction was also present, but it was associated with restrictions on the ranks of characters

- According to slaves, a separate counter of enslavement and refusal to surrender on its basis looks uncosher, IMHO, it is better to get more attached to the reputation of GG, which was done - if GG is a hero, then they surrender very willingly, but they will not surrender to a bloody murderer at all. At the same time, the influence of decisions about the crew of a surrendered ship on reputation has been changed - now it is proportional to the number of the team and very significant: enslaving 900 people will instantly lower the turnip from the maximum to the minimum, as well as throwing 450 overboard, but when released, reputation increases reluctantly

- In general, as before, the ratings of the strength of the GG and the enemy are considered, which takes into account the number of crews, all skills, reputation of the GG, "thunderstorm of the seas", etc. But if the rating of the GG is higher, then the enemy does not necessarily give up

<

> THE CURSED IDOL QUEST REWORK:

- The enemies are stronger now and the reward at the end has also increased

- A new unusual event on the global map

- Minor endings have been removed, now the story is one

- Work was carried out on the text

- After I talk with the governor, the NPC will be waiting for us at the gate with a new dialogue

- The French at the gate have been replaced by skeletons, the number of which depends on the number of GG boarders

- The usurer now has as many as 3 options for events

- James Callow is now a worthy boarder

<

> REBALANCE OF THE ARMOR

- Armor gave about 5-10% reduction in damage if the armor is numerically larger than the caliber - by percentage for each excess of the caliber of armor - as a result, the effect of armor is near zero - made similar to the armor of the hull but greatly lowered the value - so that it defies (approximately 20-50%), but only small calibers, at a large range for grapeshot or with an upgrade

- The upgrade reduced damage on command by 4 times and not by 25% as in the description

- Added grapeshot, a small effect of distance on damage

- Reduced damage reduction from the "defense" skill from 75% per 100 skill to 50%

<

> ANIMATION REBALANCE

- Everyone has a slightly increased turning speed, stronger in battle

- Added some bounce speed

- Reduced mana injection speed and penetration range for everyone, now I don't have to catch injections and punches when bouncing

- Removed the controllability of the rebound from the Musketeers - now the mouse movement does not change direction during the jump

- Changed the animations of hitting and stabbing, parrying and feint to danke

- Changed the left-right jump tribute

- The Baba-mushekter has been replaced by a hit and a block breakout with a block animation (they looked very bad), the lunge sound has been returned

- The Musketeer has the speed of the punch slowed down and the correct sound is given to him

- Adjusted the timings of all strikes and parries with swords so that the spread was no more than 20%. The timing of the punch is almost fair for everyone

<

- When tradesmen are captured, a sound signal and a text log with the number of remaining ones are played for the beard

- Disable flashing of video portraits of ships in the exchange interface

- Removed Caracas from the starting cities

- Now, after the siege of the city, the entire team will be evenly distributed on all ships of the squadron

- Crafting components and default ammo can now be generated as random loot in chests

- Added a multiplier for grapeshot and pistols with reloading turned off, 2 each - i.e. for trombone x4, arquebus with grapeshot x2

- Experience multipliers from too high a rank are cut off - no more than 3 total (i.e. the difference in rank is 5-6 times)

- Now, if a semi-immortal contract companion has sunk, then when changing the location, he will return to the ship, having been injured as a concussion. If I pick up his boat on time, there will be no injury

- Adequate looting of cities with full access to the store's warehouse has been added to all national lines

- The drop of the "excellent" loot was shifted from LVL 15 to LVL 25

- Tavern officers will no longer receive "red" weapons, and blue ones will also be generated from rank 25

- Moved the product table in the store menu to the left edge

- Redesigned squadron formations in sieges

- PGG in cemeteries no longer offer PP

- PGGS now have a limit on the number of healers, and also receive large elixirs

- During the prologue of the emergency, after the first dialogue with Guthrie and before the completion of the quest, PGG offers PP only for gold

- Added "surprises" to the fight with Flint, both pleasant and not so pleasant, and one hidden reward

- Optimized - rumor-mongering by drunks, now 2 quests at a time should not be picked up

- If, while sailing on the War Dog, I talk to Alexus about improving the ship, a new quest will start

- Now Guthrie can be killed in the prologue by failing the line of emergency

- A merchant in Cayman should no longer be loitering during the prologue of the emergency

- Slightly redesigned logic during the triggering of replica reactions in Whisper

The quest is taken only in the tavern, at sea she offers PP. Upon capture and successful completion of this quest, it is no longer possible to kill the "Guardian of the Grotto" in a vanilla way. Instead, the "Last Mass" starts when playing for any GG. The start conditions are the same as for the vehicle (rank 15)

- The choice of priority for drinking potions has been added to thoughts aloud - an analog of choosing a priority for eating food. There are 2 ways this mechanic works: 1) If without an option, then he will use the appropriate hilka, which treats exactly how much is needed, and if there is no other, then he will use a strong one, 2) With the option, priority will always be given to the hilka with the largest treatment figure.

Corsairs Ship Pack MS v2.2.0b4 (30.09.2021)

- The cuirass visualization logic has been fixed, which should reduce or completely remove new problems with them. It probably won't fix the old ones.

- The refactor of the character issuance code should now do less bullshit.

Rebalancing of the action:

- A broken block does not allow I to take full damage now, it cuts it approximately in half when broken. It works both for an irresistible blow (which is now also displayed in the log) and for breaks from maintenance / special effects.

- If the bleeding/sharp blow cannot work on the target, then they are replaced with a deep wound (separately inflicted with a small net damage)

- The more bleeds I throw in a row, the more damage they do, the base damage is reduced.

- If there was a block, but it was broken, then debuffs will not be applied.

- The logic of breakouts has been simplified, in theory it should have a positive effect on performance

1.3.0 FP

*****

1. On the instructions from the governor to destroy the gang in the jungle, 4 out of 8 bandits stood and did not fight. Edit from Myth

2. Edit locations from Sea Boss (jamb from 1.3.2 ATR).

a) Edit in the cave entrance location how to go from Chetumal Bay, where the girl asks to take her to Maracaibo, and I need to take her to Belize.

b) On Nevis, there were no characters in the fork location (3rd location, how to go from the city to the left).

c) The Church did not work at night in Antigua.

3. Fix the battle in Boca de la Sierra on the 4th task of the Slaver. Edit from Tartanist.

In the 4th task of the Slaver quest line, a battle with Indians takes place in the bay of Boca de la Sierra (model Shore03). There are two mistakes in this fight at once:

a) the last Indian and the chief are generated immediately behind the main character, like he just got out of the boat. I moved the locator of the last Indian and the chief into the general crowd.

b) there are only eight locators, and nine enemies: eight ordinary Indians and a chief. Because of this, the chief is generated in the same locator (the same one) with the last Indian in the form of a Siamese twin. I added the ninth locator to the bay, the Indians will no longer be generated in each other.

4. Edit the time spent on purchases of one item. Edit from Sea Boss

It was:

shop - 5 minutes

Shop - 15 minutes

shipyard - 30 minutes

Become:

shop - 1 minute

Shop - 5 minutes

shipyard - 10 minutes

Spend 5 minutes on one item, and then another and another. I walked around 5 shops and there are no 3 hours, and also a store. And when to fuck girls and pump luck?

5. Semi-Edit of the 5th boarding ship from Sea Boss.

Sorties with the 5th boarder during land combat and boarding. Now everything is fine with the 5th boarder, but his icon will not be displayed on the screen on the left. There is a strong suspicion that the icon is registered in the engine, but there is no access to it. In addition, 3 files from the engine were edited in the mod and maybe they missed it.

6. Stealth for ships. Edit from Sea Boss.

Edit the recognition of ships in ports. Now I can enter the port with a squadron of 8 ships. The fashion was not right. The recognition threshold, which was from 1.3.2 ATR (bdsm), has also been lowered.

7. Editing a warehouse on Bermudes from Sea Boss.

Editing a warehouse on Bermudes for 8 ships. Only 5 were displayed. The fashion was not right.

8. Added the mod removing guns from Qwerry, St.

The guns from the starboard ship are unloaded into the hold of the same starboard ship.

9. The game version is fixed on v1.3.0 FP (05.10.2019). FP Is A Fan Patch.

A large number of loading screens (44 pcs) have been added to such locations as: battle, boarding, port, sea, storm (all textures are adapted to the 16:9 format, if I like it, I will add many new loadings to all other locations).
